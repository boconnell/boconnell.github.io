Hi, I'm Brady O'Connell. I'm am a periodically- (and currently-) funemployed Software Engineer who has previously worked across the stack at companies like Uber, Remix, Google, and Palantir. I currently live in Brooklyn, previously lived in San Francisco, and grew up in Maryland.
<br>
I enjoy my free time, which I use to learn new things, play sports, travel, hike, play video games, and consume various forms of media. I spend a lot of time on the internet. I grew up playing soccer but mostly play volleyball, tennis, and basketball now. I studied Computer Science at the University of Maryland, and am an avid fan of the basketball team.
<br>
I still keep my&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/brady_oconnell">Facebook</a>&nbsp;up to date, despite it falling out of popularity. My work history is on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradyoconnell/">LinkedIn</a>. Most of my social activity these days is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/brady_oconnell">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/brady_oconnell/">Instagram</a>. At the risk of sharing way too much about myself, you can find information on the media I consume on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38768994-brady">Goodreads</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55516401">IMDB</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/bradyoactive">Last.fm</a> (although this only has fairly recent data).
