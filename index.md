Hi, I'm Brady O'Connell. I'm a Software Engineer who has previously worked across the stack at companies like Uber, Remix, Google, and Palantir. I currently live in Brooklyn, previously lived in San Francisco, and grew up in Maryland.

I like to play sports, travel, hike, play video games, and read. I love the internet. I grew up playing soccer but mostly play volleyball, tennis, and basketball now. I studied Computer Science at the University of Maryland, and am a fan of my alma mater basketball team.

I still keep [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brady.oconnell) up to date, despite it's falling popularity. My detailed work history is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradyoconnell). Most of my social activity these days is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brady_oconnell) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brady_oconnell). At the risk of sharing way too much about myself, you can find reviews of the media I consume on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38768994-brady), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55516401), and [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/bradyoactive) (although this only has fairly recent data).
