Hey, I'm Brady O'Connell! I'm a Software Engineer at Asana. I have previously worked at Uber, Remix, and Google. I currently live in Brooklyn, previously lived in San Francisco, and grew up in Maryland.

I like to play sports, travel, hike, play video games, and read. I love the internet. I grew up playing soccer but mostly play volleyball, tennis, and basketball now. I studied Computer Science at the University of Maryland and am a fan of my alma mater basketball team.

My detailed work history is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradyoconnell). I generally lurk and like memes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brady_oconnell) and share self-centered pictures (usually in nature) on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brady_oconnell). I kind of wish we had all stuck with [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brady.oconnell) (dat structure) and so I still keep that up to date. You can find reviews of the media I consume on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38768994-brady), [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55516401), and [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/bradyoactive).
