Hey, I'm Brady O'Connell! I'm a Software Engineer at Asana. I have previously worked at Uber, Remix, and Google. I currently live in Brooklyn, previously lived in San Francisco, and grew up in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

I like to play sports, travel, hike, play video games, and read. I love the internet. I grew up playing soccer but mostly play volleyball, tennis, and basketball now. I studied Computer Science at the University of Maryland and am a fan of my alma mater basketball team.
