Hey, I'm Brady O'Connell! I'm a Software Engineer at Asana. I used to work at Uber, Remix, and Google. I currently live in Brooklyn and used to live in San Francisco. I grew up in Gaithersburg, Maryland, studied Computer Science at the University of Maryland, and still root for the Terps basketball team.

I like to play sports (all of them, but mostly pickleball and volleyball these days), hike, and try new things. I love getting lost in Wikipedia rabbit holes. I've been a vegetarian/vegan for 20+ years. I've taken multiple sabbaticals to long-term solo travel.
